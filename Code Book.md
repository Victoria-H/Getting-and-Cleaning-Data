####Objective
This document describes the transformation of data from experiments on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.
The objective was to produce a tidy data set of the means and standard deviations (std) of the variables measured by the Smartphones while certain activities were performed.

More information is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The data can be downloaded here. Consult the README.txt , features.info.txt and features.txt files.

###CONTENTS
1. Description of the original data and experiment
2. Explanation of the data transformation to produce a tidy data set.



###THE ORIGINAL DATA AND EXPERIMENT

The experiment was carried out with 30 subjects within an age bracket of 19-48 years.  Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope,  3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity measures were recorded.

From these measurements, a set of variables were estimated 'features'. These features included the mean and standard deviation for each measure. These were normalised (therefore no units).


Details of the features are provided in the files features_info.txt and features.txt

The orignal data was organised as follows.
(description of what they will find in the file)

###DATA TRANSFORMATION
restate the inital objectives and describe what tidy is.

talk about the steps to providing a tidy data set
