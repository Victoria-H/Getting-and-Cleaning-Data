Objective
This document describes the transformation of data from experiments on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.
The objective was to produce a tidy data set of the means and standard deviations (std) of the variables measured by the Smartphones while certain activities were performed.

###CONTENTS
1. Description of the data and experiment
2. Explanation of the data transformation to produce a tidy data set.



###THE EXPERIMENT

The experiment was carried out with 30 subjects within an age bracket of 19-48 years.  Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKINGU PSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope,  3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity measures were recorded.

From these measurements, a set of variables were estimated 'features'. These features included the mean and standard deviation for each measure. These were normalised (therefore no units).

Details of the features are provided in the files features_info.txt and features.txt
